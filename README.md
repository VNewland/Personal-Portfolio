# Personal-Portfolio
Portfolio display for personal projects

## Description
I wanted to make a webpage that would showcase personal projects to any prospective employers. Creating this page helped me to better remember flexbox concepts. I used Miro to create a wireframe concept before I started coding and it helped me to laydown my html skeleton much faster.

## User Story
As an employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Instalation
N/A

## Usage
 Anyone viewing the page can use the navigation links at the top to traverse the page or be linked to my linkedIn account. 
 The project section will display my most recent projects where the user will be able to click on the image and link to that project's deployed page.
